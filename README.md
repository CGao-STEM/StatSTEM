# StatSTEM

Open source user friendly software code to quantify scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images by using model based fitting. This provides an accurate and precise way of extracting quantitative information from STEM images. The software written in the MATLAB language and is tested stable for different MATLAB versions (2013a, 2015a and 2016a) on several operating systems (pc, mac, linux).

Electron microscopy images will be modeled by a superposition of Gaussian peaks describing each individual atomic column. Overlap of intensities from neighbouring columns is taken into account. Structural parameters, like column positions and scattering cross sections, can be stored in a MATLAB file format. From the modelled image, the number of atoms in each atomic column can be determined.
